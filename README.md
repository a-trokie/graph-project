# StreetGraph Project
### This is an old project from my freshman year of college

## How to run
- First you have to compile the java files using the script
- In the project directory, type ./compileJ

- Then to run the project, type java StreetGraph [file.txt] [-show] [start] [end]
- For example: java StreetGraph monroe.txt -show i34 i45

## What is this project
- This project is a project that builds graphs based on real street data from the University of Rochester campus, Monroe county and NYS as a whole
- The txt files contain a list of all the nodes and edges and it is up to the program to take in that information and build a graph and display it using Java Graphics
- You can also ask for the shortest distance between 2 nodes and it will show you in the display (the shortest path will be red)
